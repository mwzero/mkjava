# MkJava

MkJava.com is collection of notes for J2EE developers and architects written during my everyday work.

MkJava.com has two peculiar differences with other web sites:

- Notes must be exhaustive: they have to help understand the theory behind.
- The code used as example, as far as possible, have to be real code used inside the project
- Notes, when is possible, are written with questions and answers approach.

This github archive contains a part of the Java code used by the tutorials and posts. 

The other Java code part is extracted directly from real projects such as:

- listfeeds.com: a feeds aggregator using NLP (entity recognition), Classification and Clustering ML algorithms
- questasera.it: a feeds aggregator about TV programs, Cinema movies and Theaters opera.

Generally, this repository is used as a "sandbox" to try new code, libraries, and framework before to adopt in real projects.
